# [Space]

[Space] is a multi-purpose bot with powerful tools such as giveaways!

This project was started by Developer Anonymous (``@dev_anony`` on Discord™) as a way to pass the time.

I would prefer that you don’t simply copy and paste the bot’s code for personal use, but instead add the bot to your server  
through [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1188501238506074222&permissions=565031741156854&scope=applications.commands+bot).

# Contributing to Development

The only requirement is to have a good understanding of Python and **know what you are writing, meaning that any attempt to create a vulnerability, joke changes, or anything that does not benefit**  
**the bot will result in a contribution ban**.
